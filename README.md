# Fast-PLL-in-CMOS
This thesis is based on the implementation of PLL as a control block. PLL alone ,if looked from a controller point of view, is a PI controller. By the addition of a PD controller, the settling time of the PLL can be greatly reduced. All the blocks in this project were designed by using TSMC 0.18u process node. The settling time of the PLL was reduced by 43\%.
